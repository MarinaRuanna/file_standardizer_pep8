# File standardizer pep8 🐍
My intention when creating this code was to the renames the script files of my python projects according to pep8, 
but it can be used to organize files in any file folder according to user preferences. 

The defaults are: 
- Only lowercase letters 
- No accents 
- Spaces are replaced by underline 
- Commas are replaced by underline
